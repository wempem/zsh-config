Why use `oh_my_zsh` when this does everything you need?
## INSTALL

Clone the Repo
`git clone https://github.com/wempem/zsh-config.git /the/path`

Allow execution
`chmod +x /the/path/zsh_plugin_install.sh`

Optional 
`If you don't have a ZDOT_DIR, you can set one. Not necessary as this will just install plugins into your $HOME path if it doesn't exist.`

Call the script
`./the/path/zsh_plugin_install.sh`

Call source wherever your .zshrc lives or restart terminal
`source $ZDOT_DIR/.zshrc`

Cheers
