Why use `oh_my_zsh` when this does everything you need?

You'll probably need to set a `ZIR_DIR` in $HOME/.xprofile (arch) or $HOME/.zprofile on mac. If neither of these files don't exist, create one. Then just run the install. EZPZ. (if copying my config, you might want to remove the source lines as the script doesn't take them into account.

Cheers
