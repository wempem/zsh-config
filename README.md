Why use `oh_my_zsh` when this does everything you need? 🤔

## INSTALL 🚀

Clone the Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/wempem/zsh-config.git /the/path
```

Allow execution
```
chmod +x /the/path/zsh_plugin_install.sh
```

Optional 
```
If you don't have a ZDOT_DIR, you can set one. Not necessary as this will just install plugins into your $HOME path if it doesn't exist.
```

Run Installer
```
./the/path/zsh_plugin_install.sh
```

Call source wherever your .zshrc lives or restart terminal
```
source $ZDOT_DIR/.zshrc
```

## NOTES

My `.zshrc` includes a custom theme that requires nerd font. In order to use, you'll need to download a font from nerd front. From there you'll be able to access nerd font icons. 
The git icon I use is `e708` and for the background effect I use `e0b4`

Cheers 😀
